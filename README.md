            <li>User can share experience using emoji-slider. The slider was moved to a separate component and created using the library (). When the user moves the slider over an emoji, it becomes colored, as does the text below it.✅</li>
            <li>User can leave a comment</li>
            <li>If the name, number, and email fields are empty or did not pass validation, the subtit button is disabled. If the user entered all the data in the fields correctly, then the setTimeOut function will work, which simulates sending data to the server, the spinner spins and a message is displayed about the successful sending to the server✅</li></ul>
