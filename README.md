<h1 align = "center">Feedback form using React-Native</h1>
<p><b>Description: </b>I wrote a feedback form where the user can fill out the form and share their experience. I wrote for Android using an emulator, namely Pixel 3a API 27 2. </p> 
<hr>

<h2>Task I completed:</h2>
<ul><li>User can input his name, number and email.✅</li><li>
            Fields were validated according to their type, and special functions were written.✅
            </li>
            <li>Fields will be highlighted in red if they fail validation.✅</li>
            <li>User can share experience using emoji-slider. The slider was moved to a separate component and created using the Slider library. When the user moves the slider over an emoji, it becomes colored, as does the text below it.✅</li>
            <li>User can leave a comment.✅</li>
            <li>If the name, number, and email fields are empty or did not pass validation, the subtit button is disabled. If the user entered all the data in the fields correctly, then the setTimeOut function will work, which simulates sending data to the server, the spinner spins and a message is displayed about the successful sending to the server.✅</li></ul>
